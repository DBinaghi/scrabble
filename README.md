things to do
============

- change interface, maybe using something similar to https://rawgit.com/danielweck/scrabble-html-ui/master/index.html (drag and drop of tiles); if not, at least make it possible to hide semitransparent overlay when clicking on it
- add Esperanto vocabulary
- add Esperanto grammar check (to confirm words built with affixes)
- add Esperanto grammar check (to suggest words to A.I.)
- shorten and clear up instructions
- add connection to words database
- clean up interface
- turn language links into combobox
- decide whether to keep multiplayer version (or at least make it disabled/enabled via config file, so that users cannot get to the index page)
